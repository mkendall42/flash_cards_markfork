#Do a second round:

puts round.turns.last.feedback()     #Verify the most recent (second) turn is wrong

#Now run it in irb to make checking variables, etc. easy!
# require 'irb'
# binding.irb
#UPDATE: pry is a bit fancier / better at debugging, so may just use this moving forward:
require 'pry'
binding.pry
